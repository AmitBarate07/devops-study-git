## GitCammands

     Explanation:

        When you run the git status command, it will display the following key information:

        1. Current branch:

        The first line of output will indicate the current branch you are on (e.g., On branch main).

        2. Staging area (index):

        It shows files that have been modified and are staged (ready to be committed). Files staged for commit will appear under a section like:
3. **Stage your changes**:
   - Once you've made changes, use `git add` to stage them for commit:
     ```bash
     git add <file>          # Stage a specific file
     git add .               # Stage all modified files
     ```
   - The `git add` command moves your changes to the staging area, preparing them to be committed.

4. **Commit your changes**:
   - After staging your changes, commit them with a message using `git commit -m`:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Descriptive message about your changes"
     ```
   - This will create a new commit with the changes you've made and the message you provided. The commit message should be concise and explain what the changes are.

5. **Push your changes**:
   - Finally, push your committed changes to the remote repository using `git push`:
     ```bash
     git push origin main      # Pushes changes to the 'main' branch
     git push origin feature-1 # Pushes changes to a specific feature branch
     ```
   - The `git push` command uploads your local commits to the remote repository, making them available to others.
